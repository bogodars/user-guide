# Website with user-guide frameworks

One implementing with [Reactour library](https://reactour.js.org/), still not happy with my way of implementing changes, guess there is more correct way.

Second [JoyRide](https://react-joyride.com/), musch less customizeble.

## Bags

After starting User gide first step is not masking full picture, after clicking next and thn previous everything works fine.

## Errors

Two errors in console.

First i assume is tables map function.

Second something wrong with styled component button.
