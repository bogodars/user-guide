# Website with user-guide framework

Implementing with [Reactour library](https://reactour.js.org/)

## Bags

After starting User gide first step is not masking full picture, after clicking next and then previous buttons everything works fine.

## Errors

1. First start

After starting developing server getting this
![Start error](https://i.ibb.co/37Ft9df/pic.png)

Saving any file just after even without changes make compile successful.

2. error the in console.

I assume that is tables map function or scroll.

Need time to fix it.
