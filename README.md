# Website with user-guide frameworks

One implementing with [Reactour library](https://reactour.js.org/), still not happy with my way of implementing changes, guess there is more correct way.

Second [JoyRide](https://react-joyride.com/), much less customizable but simple.

## Bags

After starting User gide first step is not masking full picture, after clicking next and then previous buttons everything works fine.

## Errors

1. First start

After starting developing server getting this
![Start error](https://i.ibb.co/37Ft9df/pic.png)

Saving any file just after even without changes make compile successful.

2. Two errors in console.

First i assume is tables map function.

Second something wrong with styled component button.

Need time to fix it.
